## Introduction

New York City has a diverse population with a significant portion of people from immigrant backgrounds. The NYC school system caters to thousands of children all over the city and to help keep track of school performance, [NYC's education department](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/) tracks, records, and publishes data on its students. In this project, I cover data from NYC high schools on:
  * SAT scores by schools
  * School attendance
  * Class size
  * AP test results
  * Graduation outcomes
  * Demographics
  * And parent/teacher School surveys
  
 To investigate correlations between demographics and school performance.
