## Introduction

New York City has a diverse population with a significant portion of people from immigrant backgrounds. The NYC school system caters to thousands of children all over the city and to help keep track of school performance, [NYC's education department](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/) tracks, records, and publishes data on its students. In this project, I cover data from NYC high schools on:
  * [SAT scores by schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)
  * [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt)
  * [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3)
  * [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e)
  * [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a)
  * [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j)
  * And [parent, teacher, and student school surveys](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8)
  
 The main purpose of this project is to investigate correlations between demographics and school performance in New York City schools. I analyze and visualize the data based on school, school district, and borough. 
 
## Results and Conclusions
 
 Several demographic factors correlated with SAT scores. 
 * A significant percentage of students in English Language-Learner (ELL) programs in a school had a negative correlation with average SAT Scores. This is logical given that the standard SAT is administered in English. The exam tests students in high-level English Reading and Writing comprehension. Non-native speakers may not have the same level of comprehension as a native speaker. Lower average scores were particularly concentrated in boroughs where the percentage of Non-native speakers were high, for example, the Bronx. Students in these areas may live in neighborhoods or homes where English is not the spoken language.
 * School Safety rating from teachers and students had a weak correlation with a school's average SAT scores. I conclude that school safety is a factor in a school's average SAT scores, but it is not a unique factor.
 * The percentage of Free and Reduced Lunch (FRL) program students had a significant negative correlation with a school's SAT scores. FRL can be used as a proxy for household income because qualifying for the program is based on how close a household income is to the federal poverty level. Schools with a higher percentage of low-income students tended to have lower averages on the SAT compared to schools where there was a low percentage of students using the FRL program. Student's from higher-income households are more likely to have the resources and time to have tutors or prep courses for the SAT compared to their peers in lower-income households. 
 

 ## Further Research
For further analysis, I want to research racial differences on average SAT scores. A student's race had one of the largest correlations with SAT Scores. Schools with a higher percentage of Black and Hispanic students, on average, had lower average SAT Scores compared to schools with a higher percentage of White and Asian students.  The data suggests that the SAT has racial disparities. Researching why there is a large disparity and solutions to close the gap would be helpful for this section of the project. 

The disparity was particularly noticeable for schools with a significant percentage of Hispanic students. This correlated with the percentage of ELL and students on FRL.
