## Introduction

New York City has a diverse population with a significant portion of people from immigrant backgrounds. The NYC school system caters to thousands of children all over the city and to help keep track of school performance, [NYC's education department](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/) tracks, records, and publishes data on its students. In this project, I cover data from NYC high schools on:
  * [SAT scores by schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)
  * [School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statist/7z8d-msnt)
  * [Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3)
  * [AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-AP-College-Board-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e)
  * [Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a)
  * [Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j)
  * And [parent/teacher School surveys](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8)
  
 To investigate correlations between demographics and school performance.
